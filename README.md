# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# Technical requirements

- User programmable timer
- The timer can be stopped and restarted
- References to meditation (images, text etcâ€¦)
- Simple and easy to use UI and UX
- Organized and understandable app structure
- Responsive design

# Idea 

I created a simple meditation site.

# Programming Languages

 - HTML
 - BOOTSTRAP
 - JAVASCRIPT
 - REACT
